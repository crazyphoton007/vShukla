Monitoring Gene Expression and Transcriptome changes with Cancer RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) can aid in understanding tumor classification and progression. Cancers accumulate numerous genetic changes, but typically only a few drive tumor progression. Cancer RNA-Seq can help to determine which variants are expressed in cancer samples.
Multiple Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques are applied to analyze the Cancer Genomic Data in order to retrieve insights related to various tumor types.

# [Web Scraping using Python](https://github.com/crazyphoton007/WebScraping)

1. Scrapped multiple pages for form 4 (SEC Filings).
2. Fetched Disposed/Aquired information regarding Stocks.
3. Generate proper formatted data and provide files for further processing.

# [Exploratory data analysis and Modelling of Bike rental forecast](https://github.com/crazyphoton007/Forecast_Bike-Rentals)

 1. Predict total rentals per hour for the last quarter of 2012. Determine and plot features which 
have high and low correlation with response variables. Plots graphs to understand how data is 
spread across features and with respect to response variable and providing conclusion for increasing bike rental.

# [DMQL Project](https://github.com/crazyphoton007/SQL_Project)

 Our project is to create a database that could contain entire information of restaurant business. This allows
 the restaurant business to analyze data and improve their operations and customer service by making data
 driven decisions.
