Monitoring Gene Expression and Transcriptome changes with Cancer RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) can aid in understanding tumor classification and progression. Cancers accumulate numerous genetic changes, but typically only a few drive tumor progression. Cancer RNA-Seq can help to determine which variants are expressed in cancer samples.
Multiple Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques are applied to analyze the Cancer Genomic Data in order to retrieve insights related to various tumor types.
